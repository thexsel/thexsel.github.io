## What we do

We address systems challenges in a wide range of scenarios, spanning from interactive wearables to large analytics engines. 
We take diverse approaches, including 
novel OS structures ([1](http://www.k2os.org/), [2](p/psbox/index.html)),
[kernel subsystem design](p/memif/), 
[whole-OS profiling](p/wear/), 
[binary translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05000), and
[user-level runtime design](p/streambox/).
