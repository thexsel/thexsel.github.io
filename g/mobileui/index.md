# Guarding the Integrity of Mobile Graphical User Interfaces

NSF project SaTC#1718702 and #??? is synergey between Purdue University and UC Irvine. 

Project duration: 2017 â€“- 2020.

## Overview

This project seeks to safeguard key components in mobile/IoT software stacks, taking the system security to the next level. This project develops new systems components for OS, hypervisor, and trusted execution environment, as well as new methods for analyzing and testing these components.

As the initial effort, the team treated Graphical User Interface (GUI) of mobile applications. 
An attacker may tamper with that display, maliciously hiding, altering, or entirely fabricating display contents. User apps or the cloud services providing the information may be entirely unaware of the tampering. Mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS, cannot guarantee the integrity and correctness of the app GUI content. This project is developing techniques to guarantee the integrity and correctness of security-sensitive GUI regions, to ensure that what a user sees in those regions is exactly what the app (or cloud service) intends to display. 

With the insights and experience, the team further investigates other key mobile and IoT scenarios, including edge data analytics, AR, and VR, as well as other attack vectors such as side channels.
