        <blockquote>
        Interactive wearable devices bring dramatic changes to apps and hardware, leaving the operating system (OS) design in the mist. To this end, we thoroughly examine the execution efficiency of Android Wear, a popular wearable OS. 

        <br>
        <br>
        In this project, we first characterized the behaviors of LG G Watch R operated on Android Wear. Based on the characterization results,
        we are planning to provide some concrete solutions to eliminate them.

        <br>
        <br>
        So far, we have characterized one of the most popular commodity wearable OSes - Android Wear. As reported in Mobisys paper, we've found multiple inefficiencies in
        system daemons such as unexpected idle time while launching an application, excessive function usages, etc.

                Download the important tools/data <a href="ftp://ftp.ecn.purdue.edu/xzl/software/wear/">here</a>. They include:
                <br><br>
		<ul>
                <li>Raw trace data: the raw trace data contains the data used to generate each figure/table in the paper.
                <br><br>
                <li>Parsers: all the important parsing tools such as finding the interested time interval for the events.
                <br><br>
                <li>Customized kernel: the kernel has been modified from <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/msm/+/android-msm-lenok-3.10-lollipop-wear-release">lenok 3.10</a>(upstream) so that it can support our atrace tool (enabled suspend/resume category of ftrace) and provide monolithic time clock for tracing purpose.
                <br><br>
                <li>Customized traceview: the original Android traceview does not support text-view of the function calls. We modified the source code so that we can see the text view of the function calls.
                <br><br>
		<li>Slow-motion videos (timestamped) of benchmarks.
