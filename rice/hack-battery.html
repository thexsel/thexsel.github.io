	<br />
	The power consumption is arguably the most important issue for mobile
phones nowadays. Developers and researchers usually need to know
accurate, real-time system-level power consumption of cell phones.
However, most of them don't have the access to proprietary battery
emulators to do so. This article describes our measurement approach, that is,
dissecting the battery and hijacking the battery interface. As a study
case, I show how to measure N900's power by applying such approach to
Nokia's BL-5J battery.<br />
