## What we do

We address systems challenges in a wide range of scenarios, spanning from interactive wearables to large analytics engines. 
We take diverse approaches, including 
novel OS structures ([1](http://www.k2os.org/), [2](p/psbox/index.html)),
[kernel subsystem design](p/memif/), 
[whole-OS profiling](p/wear/), 
[binary translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05000), and
[user-level runtime design](p/streambox/).

* 2019-04: StreamBox-TZ: the 3rd sequel of StreamBox, to appear at ATC'19. It describes running stream analytics at the edge secured by TrustZone.
* 2019-04: Transkernel, my favorite project among all the kernel hacks we've done so far. To appear at ATC'19.
* 2018-12: A data store designed for retrospective analytics over large videos. Check out our paper at Eurosys'19.
* 2018-11: Proper use of high banwidth memory can speed up stream analytics by 7x. Check out our paper at ASPLOS'19.
* 2018-02: Programs should learn their power consumption _in the right way_. Check out our paper at Eurosys'18.
* 2017-04: StreamBox, our scale-up streaming engine, will debut at USENIX ATC'17.
