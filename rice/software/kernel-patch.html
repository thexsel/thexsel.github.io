    Patch for Maemo Linux Kernel (v2.6.21)

	<p>
		Previously, if you want to keep N810's serial port always on, there was no perfect kernel. 
		<li>
		  With Nokia's official Mameo kernel (2.6.21), the system cannot fall into deep sleep state when the UART is enabled (Power: ~80mA @ 3.8V). 
		</li>
		<li>
		  Linux-omap kernel (>2.6.26) can manage UART's power state. However, it incurs high system idle power (~30mA @ 3.8 V), even when UART is disabled. 
		</li>

		<br>
		To address such a issue, I backport UART pm from linux-omap 2.6.28 to Maemo kernel, and create this patch.  <br>
		Though ugly, it successfully reduces system idle power to <10mA @ 3.8V.
	</p>
	<p>
		Though still not so perfect comparing with the "ideal case" (Maemo kernel: idle power when UART is disabled (<2mA @ 3.8V)), 
        <br>
            I think it is good enough as a research platform.
		<br> Maybe I will figure out how to cut off the rest part of idle power. Or maybe it is the necessary cost to keep UART on.
	</p>
	Will be released soon.
